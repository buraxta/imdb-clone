# Why IMDb Clone?
The purpose of developing the IMDb Clone project is to enhance my skills in software development and gain valuable insights into various aspects of web development. Here's what I've learned and achieved through this project:

## Full Stack Development
IMDb Clone allowed me to delve into full-stack development. I worked on both the frontend and backend of the application, gaining hands-on experience. This comprehensive approach helped me understand how different parts of a web application interact.
## Responsive Design
Creating a responsive design was essential to ensure a seamless user experience across various devices, including desktop and mobile. I learned how to use HTML, CSS, and media queries to make the application adapt to different screen sizes.
## API Integration
To provide up-to-date movie and TV show information, I integrated third-party APIs into the project. This experience taught me how to work with external data sources and handle API requests in a web application.
## Version Control
I improved my version control skills by using Git and GitHub for project collaboration. It allowed me to work on features and fixes collaboratively and manage project history efficiently.
